# e-program-display-entire-list-as-item-number-quantity-rate-and-the-amount
Before 1957, Indian currency consisted of Rupees, Annaâ€™s (16 Annas =1 rupee) and other smaller denominations. In a market, suppose that the items are sold for old currency. For every item, there is a rate in terms of (Rupees+Annas). There is a man sitting at the entrance who can take the current currency (Rupee+nayaPaise) and give old currency in exchange. Suppose that a person enters the market with current currency. He has the list of items to purchase. He prepares the list as Item number (1,2,...), quantity (units), Rate (price in old currency per unit). He gives this to the exchanger who calculates the total amount and gives that much in old currency and takes equivalent amount in current currency. Write a programme which first takes from the user the number of items. Then it takes input for quantities for each item, rate for each item and stores them in separate arrays. Then it displays the total amount in both current currency and old currency. Make the program display entire list as item number, quantity, rate, and the amount
